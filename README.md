In lieu of individual folders, there are four separate branches that contain different material for this final project:
1. Main: README.md instructions
2. Data: The files of data used for coding
3. R: The code used to inform the final project report
4. Report: Sample writing that includes the research problem, description of data, description of models, model fit, data visualization, discussion/conclusion, and reproducibility note. 

Note: The R and Report files were created via Kaggle notebook. The individual notebooks can be viewed below:
